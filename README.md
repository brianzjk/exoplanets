In this research, I developed method of classifying exoplanet candidates from the Kepler Space Telescope using various machine learning techniques. I developed preprocessing pipeline to reduce dataset to one-seventh of itâ€™s original size, leading to a seven-fold increase in speed.

I was selected to represent North Carolina and present tgus research at the 2023 International and Science Fair.

The content of the files in this repository are _really_ unorganized, and the code might be broken from testing things and not fixing it. 

(Maybe) future to-do: Rewrite abstract + paper
